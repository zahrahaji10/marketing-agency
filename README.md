## Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)

#### Head

Title of the page amended from "webpage" to a suited discriptive name of "Marketing Agency".

#### Body

[screen shoot of website](../assets/images/marketing-agency-image.jpeg)

#### Header

The header section of the website contains a navigation bar that entails the three sections of the website; Search Engine Optimization Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. However, the HTML syntax of the website had undifferentiated divsions < div > which were re-named into relevant semantic HTML elements such as header and a navbar as a subdivision in the header.

Main

The main section of the website contains three divisions that informs the reader on the types of marketing strategies. These three divisions come under sections in accordance to the semantic HTML elements therefore, the syntax were changed from < div > to < section >.

#### Aside

The sidebar division provides further information of some marketing statergies. Similar to the three sections in the main, the sidebar contains images which visually aid the website user. However, to make this website more friendly to people with disabilites, each image was provided with alternative information < alt attributes > describing the content of the image.

#### Footer

The footer division of the HTML syntax has been re-named to an appropriate semantic element of footer. Whilst all the the amendments do not cause any alterations to the website, it instead enables the syntax to remain clear, detailed and accurate for individuals to understand and follow.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CCS)

Websites commonly use the same styles for a large group of HTML class elements to provide visual consistency. This produces a repetition of CCS styling properties in CSS files. Therefore, in order to organise the structure the class elements within the divisions with repeating properties where grouped together.

As a result of re-naming HTML division elements into specific semantic elements, these amendments were also re-named on the CSS elements. For example, re-naming the < div > to < nav > in the header section of the HTML file also required the following changes to be made on the CSS file. This enabled any properties applied to < nav > to correspond accordingly as well as improving the functionally, specifically in the case of the "search engine optimization" link in the navbar.
